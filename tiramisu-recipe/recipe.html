          <h2>Preparation</h2>
              <ol>
                 <li><em>First Step</em></li>
                 <p>Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until very pale yellow <br>
                    and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted <br>
                    from the bowl. Transfer mixture to a large bowl, wiping out the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside. <br>
                    In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates soft-medium peaks. Add mascarpone and <br>
                    continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. <br>
                    Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined. <br>
                    Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside. Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish <br>
                    (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.
                  </p>
                <li><em>Second Step</em></li>
                  <p>
                    Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- they are quite porous and will fall apart if left <br>
                    in the liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish. Repeat, using half the ladyfingers, until<br>
                    you’ve got an even layer, breaking the ladyfingers in half as needed to fill in any obvious gaps (a little space in between is O.K.). <br>
                    Spread half the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfingers in one even layer. Repeat with remaining espresso-dipped ladyfingers and mascarpone mixture.<br>
                    Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Top with shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired. Cover with plastic wrap and let chill <br>
                    in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all the better) before slicing or scooping to serve.
